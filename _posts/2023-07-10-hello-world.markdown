Welcome to uhh... this thing. I'm not really sure who the audience for this thing is yet. <!--more--> Friends and family, probably? If you're reading this and don't know me personally, you're probably a fan of [my games](http://notexplosive.net/). Which is great news! That's what most of this blog is going to be about!


Anyway, hi. I'm notexplosive (usually written as NotExplosive because people will misread the former as "note-splosive"). Some people call me "Explosive." Obviously I have a "real" name, and it's not necessarily a secret, but I like going by a handle in this context. You can call me Explosive, or NotExplosive, or Not (although I don't recommend that last one).

I make video games! During the day I'm a gameplay engineer at a small Seattle-based studio. Nights and weekends I [do my own thing](http://notexplosive.net). At one point I dreamt of being a full-time indie like ConcernedApe or Toby Fox. But seeing how much money and effort goes into making even just one video game has made me rather work in a team where I can do the "fun parts" of making a game while someone else runs the actual business. Or, better yet, do all that as my day job and then make the games I really want to make on the side without having to consider marketability.

I'm an avid participant in game jams. I participated in my first game jam in 2012 (although proof of that is lost to time) and I've been jamming constantly ever since. At time of writing I have participated in 28 game jams, and that's just counting "canonical" games that I included in my [ludography][ludography].

I used to run the Game Design Club at my university, many of the jams I participated in came from that. We would put on a game jam every academic quarter (skipping summer). Running that club, and meeting people who run a similar club at a neighboring university, has built me a great [network][cool-people] of gamedev friends.

I plan on using this blog as a platform to talk about my work, sometimes in a technical way, sometimes just sharing anecdotes about development on a particular project, or some lesson that I learned. I've wanted to do something like this for a while. I've tried a couple times at doing the whole YouTuber _thing_ and I think I'm just not cut out for it. Once I've written out a script (which doesn't feel well written) and record myself reading the entire script (with a delivery I'm not satisfied with) I usually just want to start over.

So I think a blog is a better format for now. This way if I can just get my thoughts down as text it's _done._ I don't need to spend a month packaging the text into a video format.

Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy!
